Backtesting allows analysts to test and compare different trading strategies without risking any money. According to the hypothesis, if their strategy failed in the past, it is unlikely to succeed in the future (and vice versa). During testing, the total profitability and the level of risk taken are the two most important factors to consider.

A backtest, on the other hand, examines a strategy's performance in relation to a variety of variables. A successful backtest will show traders a technique that has previously produced positive outcomes. While the market never moves in the same way twice, backtesting is based on the notion that equities follow similar patterns in the past.
