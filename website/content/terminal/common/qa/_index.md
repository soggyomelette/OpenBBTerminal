In finance and investment management, **Quantitative Analysis** refers to the application of mathematical and statistical methodologies. Quantitative analysts are those that work in this subject (quants). Quants typically focus on a few topics, such as derivative structure or pricing, risk management, algorithmic trading, and investment management. Industrial mathematics jobs are similar to those in other industries. The procedure usually entails scanning through large databases for patterns, such as correlations between liquid assets or price movement patterns (trend following or mean reversion). High-frequency trading may be used in the resulting strategies.
