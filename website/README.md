## Install Hugo

Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).

## Run Locally

Go into `website` directory with:

```bash
cd website
```

And run:

```bash
hugo server -D
```

If everything is working well, the following should appear:

```txt

This will be important for the addition of features to the Hugo Server.

## Adding Features

### Structure

This is the structure that the documentation follows:

```txt
website/content/_index.md
               /stocks/_index.md
                      /load/_index.md
                      /candle/_index.md
                      /discovery/_index.md
                                /ipo/_index.md
                                    /...
                                /...
                      /...
               /cryptocurrency/_index.md
                              /chart/_index.md
                              /defi/_index.md
                                   /borrow/_index.md
                                   /...
                              /...
               /...
               /common/_index.md
                      /technical_analysis/_index.md
                                         /ema/_index.md
                                         /...
                      /...
```

Note that the `common` folder holds features that are common across contexts, e.g. `technical analysis` can be performed on both `stocks` or `crytpo`.

### New Feature

To add a new command, there are two main actions that need to be done:

1. Create a directory with the name of the command and a `_index.md` file within. Examples:

   - When adding `ipo`, since this command belongs to context `stocks` and category `discovery`, we added a `ipo` folder with a `_index.md` file within to `website/content/stocks/discovery`.
   - When adding `candle`, since this command belongs to context `stocks`, we added a `candle` folder with a `_index.md` file within to `website/content/stocks/`.

2. The `_index.md` file should have the output of the `command -h` followed by a screenshot example (with white background) of what the user can expect. Note that you can now drag and drop the images while editing the readme file on the remote web version of your PR branch. Github will create a link for it with format (https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/***/***.file_format).

Example:

---

```shell
usage: ipo [--past PAST_DAYS] [--future FUTURE_DAYS]
```

Past and future IPOs. [Source: https://finnhub.io]

- --past : Number of past days to look for IPOs. Default 0.
- --future : Number of future days to look for IPOs. Default 10.

<IMAGE HERE - Use drag and drop hint mentioned above>

3. Update the Navigation bar to match the content you've added. This is done by adding 2 lines of code to `website/data/menu/`, i.e. a `name` and a `ref`. Example:

```
---
main:
  - name: stocks
    ref: "/stocks"
    sub:
      - name: load
        ref: "/stocks/load"
      - name: candle
        ref: "/stocks/candle"
      - name: discovery
        ref: "/stocks/discovery"
        sub:
          - name: ipo
            ref: "/stocks/discovery/ipo"
          - name: map
            ref: "/stocks/discovery/map"
```
